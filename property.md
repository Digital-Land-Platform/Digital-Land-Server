# Documentation for Property Entity Fields

This documentation is intended to guide developers working on the Digital Land Platform regarding the structure of the Property entity using SQLAlchemy and Strawberry. Each field is explained to provide a clear understanding of what is expected when working with property listings.

## Property Entity Fields

1. id (String, UUID):

- *Description:* A unique identifier for each property, automatically generated by the system.
- *Purpose:* Used to uniquely distinguish properties in the database and within API calls.

1. title (String):

## Sample Property Entity in SQLAlchemy with Strawberry

Here is the SQLAlchemy model for the Property entity using Strawberry for GraphQL.

### Sample Models

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, String, Float, DateTime, Text, Integer, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship
from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import UUID
import uuid
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
import strawberry
from datetime import datetime

Base = declarative_base()

@strawberry.type
class Property:
    id: str
    title: str
    description: str
    price: float
    size: float
    status: str
    location: str
    neighborhood: str
    city: str
    country: str
    latitude: float
    longitude: float
    images: list[str]
    virtualTourUrl: str
    streetViewUrl: str
    additionalFeatures: list[str]
    yearBuilt: int
    legalStatus: str
    disclosure: str
    energyRating: str
    sustainabilityFeatures: list[str]
    futureDevelopmentPlans: str
    zoningInformation: str
    createdAt: datetime
    updatedAt: datetime
```

```python
class PropertyModel(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'properties'

    id = Column(UUID(as_uuid=True), primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4)
    title = Column(String, nullable=False)
    description = Column(String, nullable=False)
    price = Column(Float, nullable=False)
    size = Column(Float, nullable=False)
    status = Column(String, nullable=False)
    location = Column(String, nullable=False)
    neighborhood = Column(String, nullable=False)
    city = Column(String, nullable=False)
    country = Column(String, nullable=False)
    latitude = Column(Float, nullable=True)
    longitude = Column(Float, nullable=True)
    images = Column(Text, nullable=False)  # Storing list of image URLs as text
    virtualTourUrl = Column(String, nullable=True)
    streetViewUrl = Column(String, nullable=True)
    additionalFeatures = Column(Text, nullable=True)  # Storing list as text
    yearBuilt = Column(Integer, nullable=True)
    legalStatus = Column(String, nullable=False)
    disclosure = Column(Text, nullable=True)
    energyRating = Column(String, nullable=True)
    sustainabilityFeatures = Column(Text, nullable=True)  # Storing list as text
    futureDevelopmentPlans = Column(String, nullable=True)
    zoningInformation = Column(String, nullable=True)
    createdAt = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
    updatedAt = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow, onupdate=datetime.utcnow)
```

## Notes for Developers

List fields like *images*, *additionalFeatures*, and *sustainabilityFeatures* are stored as text `(CSV-style)` for simplicity but can be optimized using a more structured approach.

Optional fields such as *virtualTourUrl* and *latitude/longitude* are nullable and can be omitted when not applicable.

Dates *(createdAt, updatedAt)* are automatically set and updated on record creation and updates, respectively.
