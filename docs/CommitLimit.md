# Here is the reason why we enforce limited number of commit per PR

The reason we ask for a limited number of commits per pull request (PR), like two, for several reasons:

1. **Clarity and Simplicity**: Having just a few commits makes it easier for reviewers to understand the changes being made. This prevents confusion from too many small, scattered changes that might be hard to follow.

2. **Focused Changes**: Limiting commits encourages contributors to submit pull requests that focus on a single issue or feature, rather than bundling multiple unrelated changes in one PR.

3. **Better Review Process**: Reviewers can more easily track and analyze the logic and progress of changes when the number of commits is minimal, which can lead to faster reviews and fewer mistakes.

4. **Commit History Cleanliness**: Fewer, well-organized commits help maintain a clean and readable commit history, making it easier to track down specific changes or bugs in the future.
